	<h2>Around Columbia</h2>
	<p>Education has played a vital role in Columbia’s development. <a href='#'>Stephens College</a> was first established as Baptist Female College in 1855. It changed its name to Stephen’s College for Women in 1870. Today, it is one of the most widely respected women’s colleges in the US.</p>
	<p>The University of Missouri was founded in 1839. Controversy over where the University would be built began in the 1830's. Six counties bid on the project; most of them were only able to raise a little over $1,000. Boone Couty was able to raise more than $118,000 in cash, land and buildings. The state did not appropriate funds o the University until 1867. When Academic Hall Burned down in 1892, there was talk of moving the University to another community. In order to keep it in Columbia, citizens raised $50,000 for the constructin of Jesse Hall. Today, the <a href='#'>University of Missouri</a> has a student population of more than 30,000 and is Columbia's largest employer.</p>
	<p>Other top industries are healthcare and insurance. Columbia has one of the highest hospital beds per capita ratios in the country. It has been frequently ranked as a top place to live, best place to raise a family, and great community to which to retire. The things make it so livable, also make it a great destination to visit.</p>
	<p>Columbia's most commonly recognizable architectural attributes reside downtown and within the university campuses. Widely used icons of the city are the University of Missouri's Jesse Hall and the neo-gothic Memorial Union. The David R. Francis Quadrangle is an example of Thomas Jefferson's academic village concept. There are four historic districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places within the city: Downtown Columbia, East Campus Neighborhood, Francis Quadrangle, and North Ninth Street Historic District. The downtown skyline is relatively low and is dominated by the 10-story Tiger Hotel, and the 15-story Paquin Tower.</p>
	<p>Downtown Columbia is an area of approximately one square mile surrounded by the University of Missouri on the south, <a href='http://ccis.edu'>Columbia College</a> on the north, and Stephens College to the east. The area serves as Columbia's financial and business district and is the topic of a large initiative to draw tourism, which includes plans to capitalize on the area's historic architecture, and Bohemian characteristics.</p>
