	<p>The hotel has a long history of relationship with Columbia College. That’s how the hotel got its name. In fact, many of their customers are parents of Columbia College who visit their children on campus, or alumni of the college. They have been a strong sponsor of Cougar Team since it was founded in 1996</p>
	<p>Education has played a vital role in Columbia’s development. Columbia College was established in 1851 as Christian Female College by the Disciples of Christ Church, and was the first women’s college west of the Mississippi. It became a coeducational, four-year college in the 1970’s and changed its name to Columbia College.</p>
